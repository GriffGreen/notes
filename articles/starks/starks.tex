Ingredients for STARKs:

Encode the computational task into a polynomial problem.

IOP: Prover and verifier exchange messages. In many cases, prover sends gigantic message, but verifier only reads a tiny bit.
In such a setting, prover can merkelize, only send root hash and verifier can request parts of the message plus Merkle proof.

(Probabilistically Checkable) Proof of Proximity: Ensures that the polynomial used by the prover is ``close'' to a low-degree polynomial.

From ``Computational integrity with a public random string from
quasi-linear PCPs.'':

Encode the computation trace as a sequence of $N$ elements from $\mathcal{F}_{2^64}$ and encode this in a polynomial of
degree $N-1$ over $\mathcal{F}_{2^64}$.

ACSP (algebraic constraint satisfaction problem) - NTIME(n)-complete.
  Instances: 



Reed-solomon-Codes: Univariate polynomial of high degree.

PCPPs only have oracle access to the statement and proof and check that the proof is ``close'' to a true statement.
In contrast, PCPs have full access to the statement and oracle access to the proof and check that the statement is true.

Low-degree test: Procudure to check if a function we have oracle access to (i.e. can ask to be evaluated) is a multivariate polynomial of ``low'' degree.

Zero-tester: efficient procedure to verify if a function given by an oracle is close to a multivariate polynomial that is
zero on every point in a prespecified subset of its domain

New approach in BS08:
 - reduce SAT to zero-testing. Reduce zero-testing to low-degree testing.
